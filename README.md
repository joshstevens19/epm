# ethereumPM
ethereum package manager to share solidity contracts.

# introduction

solidity is a up and coming langugage which needs the same community as NPM and NuGet to thrive. This application is going to allow developers to push versioned solidity contracts into a cloud repo which are then downloadable. 

A CLI will be written to allow command line tools to download these repos. The aim is to to make it similar to NPM and allow the community to grow. 

If anyone is interested in helping please drop me a email joshstevens19@hotmail.co.uk - i will be working and planning this slowly for the next month or so. 

Here is to the future of reusable contracts :D

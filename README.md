# epm
ethereum package manager to share solidity contracts.

# introduction

solidity is a up and coming langugage which needs the same community as NPM and NuGet to thrive. This application is going to allow developers to push versioned solidity contracts into a cloud repo which are then downloadable. 

A CLI will be written to allow command line tools to download these repos. The aim is to to make it similar to NPM and allow the community to grow. A UI will follow. All request go through the epm-api which is being written.

The aim is to get this completed and deployed for beta by end of play October!

Here is to the future of reusable contracts :D
